# Module 2 Challenge

## Description

This challenge was given in order to test our skills in HTML and CSS.
This challenge consisted of the developer (myself) designing a web application displaying my ongoing progress in the Full Stack Bootcamp houseing contact information, photos, and live deployed applications, all in one convenient spot.  This challenge was both "a challenge" and a practical, useful tool.  
I personally appreciated this challenge very much and will continue to update it in the future with other live deployments as I create them.
